OpenShift Virtualization
---------------------------------------------------------------------

A feature of OpenShift Container Platform, [OpenShift Virtualization](https://www.openshift.com/learn/topics/virtualization/) combines two technologies into a single management platform so organizations and developers can bring VMs into containerized workflows. This is accomplished by running a VM within a container. Developers can develop, manage, and deploy VMs side-by-side with containers and serverless all in one platform.
