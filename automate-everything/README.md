Automate Everything
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Ansible is a radically simple IT automation engine that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other IT needs. 

Announced at [Red Hat Summit 2020](https://www.redhat.com/en/summit), Ansible Automation Platform harnesses the power of Ansible automation + new modules/functionality, Ansible Cloud Services and the latest Ansible Engine & Tower updates, all under one roof, one subscription - one platform.
